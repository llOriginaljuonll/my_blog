# My Blog Project
This is a project for my practice, a project about making a personal blog. But users can view the blog. For me, the content of the blog is about the programming that I have done.

This project is using python langauge and django framework for the backend. django template and tailwindcss for the frontend. sqlite for database.

## Installation
1. Create pip environment for this project. This project. .gitignore file has been created by this project and specified environment folder to be ignored.
	```
	python -m venv { name of env.}
	```
2. Activate environment.
	```
	{ name of env.}\Scripts\activate
	```
3. Install all packages pip with and requirements.txt
	```

4. Normally, if we install django, we will already have sqlite as default. But I recommend installing sqlite to be able to use sql command line, it will make us work more efficiently.
